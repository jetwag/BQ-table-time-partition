### S3 Download Using DuckDB

This template provides a powerful and efficient solution for downloading and processing large-scale data files from AWS S3 using DuckDB. It's specifically designed to handle big data scenarios where traditional download methods might be impractical or inefficient.

## Overview

The template combines the power of Keboola's AWS S3 extractor with DuckDB's advanced processing capabilities to enable:
- Efficient handling of large-scale data files
- Memory-optimized processing through columnar storage
- Direct querying and transformation of data during download
- Support for various file formats (JSON, CSV, Parquet)

## Key Features

1. **Optimized Large File Processing**
   - Uses DuckDB's columnar storage engine for efficient data handling
   - Processes data in chunks to manage memory usage
   - Supports parallel processing for improved performance

2. **Smart Data Handling**
   - Configurable memory limits to prevent out-of-memory issues
   - Automatic handling of different file formats and compression
   - Direct data transformation during the download process

3. **Flexible Configuration**
   - Customizable AWS credentials and bucket settings
   - Adjustable DuckDB processing parameters
   - Support for subfolder processing and file filtering

## Technical Details

The template utilizes:
- Keboola AWS S3 Extractor for secure S3 access
